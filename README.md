# MediaVault
This is a media vault which allow users to save their movies and tv series to the server.

This project uses JAVA and JSP language.

I didn't use database, but I implement use-database version now instead of using File to save and retreive files.

If you want the database version, just send me e-mail.

This is my JSP course assignment in the university.

I have deploy this webpage on the internet and the site is "www.aishanghai.xin:8080/Assignment3.0/homePage.html"
